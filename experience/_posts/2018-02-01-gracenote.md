## Company

[Gracenote](http://www.gracenote.com/) is an international company, bought by Nielsen. I did my internship in the office based in Seoul. 

Gracenote provides meta-data and automatic content recognition technologies worldwide. 

## Project

For the first 2 months of my internship, I mainly improved the existing tests on the video ACR system.
The goal was to discover the languages and the tools, as well as to get familiar with the video ACR system.

After that, I implemented my own tests on an uncovered specific component of the system : the client library. 

Skills & technologies
{:.lead}

The language used during this internship was `Ruby`, coupled with `Gherkin` (a language to write tests) through `Cucumber`.

For test automation, we used `Jenkins`, that I managed to understand and operate proficiently. We also used widely `Git`, `Linux`, `Bash`.

Tests were managed through `Jira`. I also had to manage myself and planify the project, which I did mainly through `Gantt` charts.

## What I learned

Working in a big structure like Gracenote was a great opportunity for me. Moreover, the international background was really pleasant.

I discovered a new field of computer science : QA. It broadened my perspective.

Also, even if my direct boss was French (we used French shamelessly), I had to cooperate with other colleagues. We overcame language barrier with creativity !

## Recommendation

> Throughout his internship, Nicolas showed a great seriousness and huge level of involvment. The work done is of high quality, and his attention to details was valuable (particularly for his documentation effort).
