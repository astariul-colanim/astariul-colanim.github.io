## Company

[Spacewalk](https://www.spacewalk.tech/) is a Korean proptech start-up, located in Seoul. They use Machine Learning and more precisely Reinforcement Learning to generate architecture designs at a reduced cost. 

## Projects

### Parking layout optimization

I'm working on a module that optimize parking layout generation. The problem is challenging due to the various constraints imposed by law.

To solve this task, I trained a **Transformer** network using Deep Reinforcement Learning with **PPO**. Example of generated parkings :

## What I learned

This job was my first opportunity to learn about reinforcement learning, a very interesting field of machine learning.
Applying this to real-world problem is both challenging and rewarding.

I am part of a team with only great people, with immense technical knowledge, from whom I'm learning a lot.
