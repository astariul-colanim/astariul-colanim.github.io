# Education

I have a Engineer degree (equivalent of Master degree) from [ESISAR](http://esisar.grenoble-inp.fr/en) - [Grenoble INP](http://www.grenoble-inp.fr/en), a public school specialized in computer sciences & network security. 

Beyond the courses offered by the school, students also have several opportunities to discover the world of work, through internships and a special semester (called "Industrial Project") where they work full-time for a company, among a student team. 

It's also possible to make a semester abroad, in a different university.
