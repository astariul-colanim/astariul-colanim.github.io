## Project

Notion is convenient to write any kind of documentation, including **technical documentation**. Unfortunately it lacks features, like `autodoc`.

`docution` is a **command line** that **write** and **format** your **python docstrings** directly into Notion pages.

With the recent release of the official Notion API, this was the perfect occasion for this project !

## Experience

It was an interesting journey, not everything went according to plan but eventually I could have something working.

However, I hit a wall : because the official Notion API is still in Beta, **some features were lacking**. These features are necessary for `docution`, so for now the project is on hold.
