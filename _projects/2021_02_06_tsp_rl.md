## Project

This is a **Pytorch** reimplementation of [`encode-attend-navigate`](https://github.com/MichelDeudon/encode-attend-navigate), which is a Tensorflow-1.x TSP solver (_Traveling Salesman Problem_) based on **Transformer** and **Reinforcement Learning**.

For this reimplementation, I made sure every layers were correctly implemented by **testing** them, ensuring the outputs were similar with the TF1 implementation.

I also used newer tools (`wandb`), and made sure the results can be reproduced by anyone (**Colab notebook** provided, the network can be trained in 1 hour with a free GPU).

## Experience

This was an interesting experience as I'm not very familiar with Tensorflow1.x. I could overcome this weakness through **persistent testing**.

At first I had difficulties to reproduce the results of the official repository, but eventually I discovered the bug, fixed it and I could reproduce the original results. It's interesting to see how sensible RL training is !
