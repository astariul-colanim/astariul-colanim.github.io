My own implementation of a streamlit-like library

## Project

`streamlit` is awesome. Being able to deploy cool-looking front-end without knowing anything about front-end is a really nice thing.

But `streamlit` is opaque, sometimes not natural with their caching system, and we can't really customize the application further.

So I decided to implement my own version of a `streamlit`-like library, with better features :
* Based on `FastAPI` instead of `Flask`
* Transparent
* Easy to customize

## Experience

For this project I'm trying to focus on design and usability. I also got more familiar with library such as `FastAPI`.

Finally, I'm getting more and more experience on managing a package hosted on Github : issues, pull requests, project board, releases, etc...
