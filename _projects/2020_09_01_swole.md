## Project

`streamlit` is an awesome library. But `streamlit` is opaque, sometimes not natural with their caching system, and we can't really customize the application further.

So I decided to implement my own version of a `streamlit`-like library, with better features :
* Based on `FastAPI` instead of `Flask`
* Transparent
* Easy to customize

## Experience

For this project I'm trying to focus on interface design and usability. I also got more familiar with external libraries such as `FastAPI`, `dominate`, etc...

I'm feeling more and more at ease with managing packages hosted on Github : **issues**, **pull requests**, **milestones**, **releases**, etc...
