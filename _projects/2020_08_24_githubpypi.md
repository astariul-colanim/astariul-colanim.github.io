## Project

I wanted to make it easy for people to index and manage their private Python packages.

After researching I saw a blogpost about how to deploy your own PyPi index. But I wasn't satisfied with the look of the PyPi index, as well as the difficulty to manage it.

So I decided to develop my own Github template, to make it easy to deploy. I made this template cleaner, and much easier to use / manage through automated Pull Requests created with Github Actions.

## Experience

Through this project I developed **my own Github Actions**, tailored for this project, to make it easy to manage packages.

I also learned more about Python packaging and reading specifications like [PEP503](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0503/).
