## Project

I started this project because I enjoy Haikus, and because I never had the experience to use a Database in practical.

I used [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login) to host both the website and the database.

## Experience

While simple, this project was a great learning opportunity. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, javascript, web developement in general. Front-end is **not** my domain, but I think having basics skills everywhere is important. I struggled with the front-end part of the project, but eventually I'm happy with the result.

One of the goal of this project was to use a database hosted online. The reason is that while I was student, I studied SQL and databases in general, but I never had the occasion to host my own database and maintain it. The database for this project is simplistic, and it was perfect for a project of this size.

I wrote unit tests, and I decided to try Github Actions as a CI tool. It was a fantastic experience, and I will definitely set up Github Actions again for future projects.
