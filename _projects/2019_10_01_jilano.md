## Project

I started this project for 2 reasons. First, I enjoy Haikus. Second, I never had the experience to use a Database in a real application.

I used [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/), a python web framework by Plotly, and hosted both the website and the database on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/login).

## Experience

While this project is very simple from a technical point of view, I still met challenges along the way and it's overwall a great learning experience.

First and foremost, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, javascript, web developement in general. Front-end is **not** my domain, but I think having basics skills everywhere is important. I struggled with the front-end part of the project, but I'm happy with the result.  

One of the goal of this project was to use a database hosted online. The reason is that while I was student, I studied SQL and databases in general, but I never had the occasion to host my own database and maintain it. The database for this project is simplistic, and it was perfect for learning.

The biggest challenge of this project was the framework choice. I initially started with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), but was quickly limited by the absence of customization. I then went for [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/). The simplicity of the framework was what I was looking for. The simplicity of this project allowed me to make such a choice, but I realized later on that if the project came to be more complicated, Dash would not be the best choice.

Of course I wrote tests, and I decided to try Github Actions as a CI tool. It was a fantastic experience, and I will definitely set up Github Actions again for future projects.
