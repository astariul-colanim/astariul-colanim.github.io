## Project

I created this project because it's not the first time I needed to create a Discord bot, and everytime I struggle to find a way to make my bot's command easy to use, and easy to access. So I made this project to make an interactive menu using the message and reaction system of Discord.

Furthermore, I realized I could improve the whole thing with input from users, making it even more interactive.

## Experience

This project was truly interesting, because even if :

* the idea is nothing new : similar interactive menu idea existed already.
* the code itself is very short : 200 lines of code only.

Yet, developing this idea into a general framework that can be used by others needed a strong design.

It was also a great occasion for me to write a documentation describing the project (see the [wiki pages](https://github.com/astariul/discord_interactive_help/wiki))

Finally, it gave me the experience of releasing and maintaining a [Pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/discord-interactive/).
