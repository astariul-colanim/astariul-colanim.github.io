Bonjour !

My name is Nicolas, and I'm a software engineer from France.

## Story time

I grew up in France, next to Lyon. Pretty normal childhood, along with Pokemon and other computer games.

I discovered computer science through calculator programming during my highschool classes. Choosing a computer science education was a pretty natural choice.

## What I do every day

If I find a project that passionate me, I'll spend my nights on it !

During week-end I like going out, either riding bike or hiking to nearby mountain, discovering surrounding nature !

Even if I'm not good at it, I love playing video games. PC-bang in Korea are a child's dream for that matter.

## What I enjoy

I prefer winter to summer, without a doubt. Maybe this come from my obsession for ski, snowboard, and overall mountain. And the beauty of snow, of course.

I like to travel. I visited many countries, met a lot of different cultures, and I'm always looking for a new challenge in a different part of the world - there's always more to discover.

Chocolate. I enjoy chocolate.
